PROJECT ROADMAP - PROJECT-P1L0T (v15 FINAL SHIP VERSION)
VISION STATEMENT:
"This is Titanfall 3 - built through systems, memory, mastery, and respect for the player."

This document is BOTH a design manifesto AND a production contract.
It defines WHAT we build, HOW we build it, and HOW we avoid breaking it.

Core project rule: every update or feature MUST be reflected in the GitHub repo.
Roadmap acts as the single source of truth for Codex and collaborators.

====================================================================
SECTION 0 - ABSOLUTE CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================================
- Systems over spectacle
- Persistence over resets
- Mastery over grind
- Player agency over AI cleverness
- Failure is canon
- No live-service manipulation
- No real ML - rule-based only
- Reuse assets, reuse code, reuse patterns
- Do not delete broken things - FIX them

If a decision violates these rules, it is WRONG.

====================================================================
SECTION 1 - THE CREATION PATH (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)
====================================================================
ALL FEATURES MUST FOLLOW THIS PATH - NO EXCEPTIONS.

STEP 1 - CREATE, NEVER DESTROY
DO:
- Create new files when experimenting
- Create new modules when behavior changes
- Create wrappers, adapters, shims
- Rewrite broken code into a clean replacement
- Deprecate old paths safely
DON'T:
- Delete code "because it doesn't work"
- Rip out systems without understanding intent
- Remove logic just to silence errors
- Break backward compatibility casually
RULE: Broken code is TECHNICAL DEBT, not trash. Debt must be paid down, not erased.

STEP 2 - DEFINE THE CONTRACT (BEFORE CODING)
Every change MUST start with a written contract:
- Goal (player-facing result)
- Inputs (what triggers it)
- Outputs (what changes)
- Server-authoritative state
- Persistence impact
- Fail-safes
- Acceptance criteria
- Test plan
If this is missing, STOP.

STEP 3 - DATA & CONFIG FIRST
DO:
- Define data structures first
- Add schema_version to all persistent data
- Add config knobs (cvars/json)
- Provide safe defaults and fallbacks
DON'T:
- Hardcode tuning values
- Assume data always exists
- Crash on missing or old saves

STEP 4 - SERVER STATE MACHINE
DO:
- Implement explicit state machines
- Log all state transitions
- Add timeouts to all states
- Make server authoritative
DON'T:
- Hide state in booleans
- Let clients decide outcomes
- Allow infinite loops or dead states

STEP 5 - OBSERVABILITY BEFORE POLISH
DO:
- Add debug toggles
- Add dev console commands
- Add logging for: state changes, saves/loads, AI decisions
DON'T:
- Add UI, FX, or VO first
- "Hope it works" without inspection

STEP 6 - UI & FLAVOR LAST
DO:
- Bind UI strictly to real state
- Keep UI subtle
- Prefer text/radio over cinematics
DON'T:
- Fake systems with UI
- Add spectacle without mechanics

STEP 7 - REGRESSION & SHIP
DO:
- Run full test checklist
- Verify lobby -> match -> PvE -> extraction
- Verify persistence
- Update roadmap + changelog

====================================================================
SECTION 2 - GLOBAL DO & DON'T (CODING LAW)
====================================================================
ABSOLUTE DO
- Create files
- Rewrite code cleanly
- Refactor safely
- Add compatibility layers
- Add migration paths
- Fix bugs at the root cause
- Leave code BETTER than you found it

ABSOLUTE DON'T
- Delete broken code
- Remove systems to "make it work"
- Comment out logic permanently
- Ship uninspectable behavior
- Trade stability for speed

Rule of thumb: If something breaks - UNDERSTAND IT, THEN FIX IT.

====================================================================
SECTION 3 - CORE SYSTEMS (LOCKED)
====================================================================
This project ships with TWO learning systems:
1) NEMESIS SYSTEM (Enemy that remembers you)
2) BUDDY TITAN SYSTEM (Ally that learns you)
These systems are MIRRORS. One hunts you. One protects you.
Both are persistent. Both are rule-based. Both are sacred.

====================================================================
SECTION 4 - BUDDY TITAN PRIME DIRECTIVE
====================================================================
PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: PROTECT PILOT
- Buddy Titan may force eject pilot to save them, sacrifice itself, issue tactical callouts
- Player agency ALWAYS wins
- Forced actions are rare, justified, configurable
This directive outranks objectives, target elimination, Titan self-preservation.

====================================================================
SECTION 5 - NEMESIS SYSTEM CONTRACT
====================================================================
- Nemesis foreshadows, retreats, returns, remembers, holds grudges
- Nemesis adapts deterministically
- Nemesis failure or escape becomes canon
Death is iteration, not deletion.

====================================================================
SECTION 6 - IDENTITY & LEGACY
====================================================================
- Titan chassis != Titan OS
- Player names Titan OS on first launch
- OS name persists and speaks
- Player save IS the campaign
- No resets, no prestige, no FOMO

====================================================================
SECTION 7 - FAILURE IS CONTENT
====================================================================
- Losses persist, world remembers, NPCs react, Nemesis evolves
- Titan sacrifices matter
Failure is not rollback - it is STORY.

====================================================================
SECTION 8 - FINAL SHIP RULE
====================================================================
If a feature:
- Breaks movement
- Removes player agency
- Deletes history
- Encourages grind
- Relies on randomness
- Requires deleting code to function
IT DOES NOT SHIP.

====================================================================
SECTION 9 - IMPLEMENTATION PHASES (ACTIVE BACKLOG)
====================================================================
PHASE 1 - LOBBY FOUNDATION
1) Lobby Mode (Exoplanet)
   - Players spawn into Exoplanet as a free-roam lobby.
   - Acts as the main hub before any match.

   - When all players are ready, they board a dropship.
   - Boarding the ship triggers match start (Attrition-style extraction logic).
3) Friend Invite System (Lobby)
   - Invite friends directly into the lobby.
   - Seamless party management.
4) Invite Lobby -> Match
   - Pull invited friends directly from lobby into the active game.

PHASE 2 - LOBBY INTERACTIVITY
5) NPCs in Lobby
   - Roaming NPCs.
   - Interact to change loadouts, settings, utilities.
